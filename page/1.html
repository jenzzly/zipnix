<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
Hacking is a word in cyber security world that usually refer to people who steal and compromise data. However, those people are known as crackers. This project will clarify some of the misunderstanding of hacking and the approach to become a hacker.
</p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
Learning programming is the most important tool you need to learn as a hacker.  What programming language should you pick? There are hundreds to choose from and a good hacker knows more than one so it may seem difficult to find a starting point. If you have no programming experience, Python is the best place to start. 
</p>
<h2>Build Tools</h2>
<p>
With your knowledge on programming and computer in general, as a hacker you should soon start to build your own tools. The very first thing, you should be able to build a computer. This is beneficial for numerous reasons. You will understand very well how computer works and be able to build powerful tools. As hacking goes, you will soon start to get into advance topics that involves inventing tools that might be useful world wide. 
</p>
<h2>Use a Different OS</h2>
<p>
It’s no secret that Windows computers make up a large percentage of the computers used in homes and businesses. In fact, you are probably reading this article on a Windows computer right now (at least the odds say you are).
</p>
<p>
What you will quickly learn as a hacker is that most large corporate systems and Web servers do not run on Windows. Many of them run on UNIX or Linux. Even search engine giant Google uses Linux servers. The only way to get accustomed to how these operating systems work is to use them.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Linux is free in most cases. Even better, it’s open source so you can modify the operating system as you see fit. This is a great way to learn OS hacking and it could become a very useful skill as you attempt to gain access to large corporate servers.
</p>
<h2>Understand Networking</h2>
<p>
Hackers rely almost exclusively on basic networking principles to access systems. After all, just about anyone can sit in front of a computer and pull information off of it. It takes the skills and knowledge of a hacker to do this same task remotely and anonymously.
</p>
<p>
If you have no networking experience, consider taking Computer Networking to learn networking basics. A course like this gives you a solid foundation that you can apply to various hacking scenarios throughout your hacking career.
</p>
<p>
Remember that being a hacker doesn't necessarily mean performing illegal activities. There are many hackers who make a respectable living without breaking any laws. By using their knowledge, they find loopholes and vulnerabilities in existing systems, notify the companies with the vulnerabilities, and receive large bounty rewards for their efforts. Even major companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google all offer large cash rewards to hackers that discover vulnerabilities.
